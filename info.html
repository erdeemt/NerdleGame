        Guess the NERDLE in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to today's solution.

        There are 8 characters

        A character is one of "0123456789+-*/=" (normally! We've added some extra maths symbols in games like maxi.nerdle but you'll see these on the keyboard)
       
        A valid guess must be a calculation that is mathematically correct.
        So it must have one "="

        Also, the number on the right of the "=" is just a number (not another calculation)

        Standard order of operations applies, so calculate * and / before + and -
       
        Commutative answers are accepted. i.e. if today's answer is 10+20=30, then 20+10=30 will also be accepted. However the commutativity rule only applies when everything else matches today's target solution.</div>
